## 2. Watch the Tutorial

Once in the race viewer:

## 3. Use the Compass

Turn your boat using:

- Or **click and drag** the blue diamond on the compass

**Don't worry** - your course will not change until you confirm it with the **'Set'** button!

## 4. Customize Your View

You have a lot of control over the look of the charts and controls:
