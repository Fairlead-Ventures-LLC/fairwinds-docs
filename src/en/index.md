# Getting Started

<p class="lead">New to FairWinds? Here's the fastest way to get sailing.</p>

For an absolute minimum 10-minute crash course (with no actual crashing) - watch the FairWinds Quick Start tutorial: https://youtu.be/1WSZaWi8wng

## 1. Do a Practice Race

From the dashboard click **Practice → Show all**. The Waikiki practice is 1nm and takes about 10 minutes — perfect for getting your bearings.

## 2. Click through the In-Game Tutorial

Once you have a race loaded:

1. Click on the **Nav menu** (the book icon) - there is a short flyover tutorial:

## 3. Important Buttons

## 4. Play with the Wind Map

Each button in the wind control panel toggles a wind layer on/off. You don't need to join a race to explore the weather. The wind map has the same controls as the races — great for experimenting without being in a race: https://fairwinds.world/wind/map

## Zooming and Panning

FairWinds relies heavily on map interactions and acts just like all online maps. Having a good mouse with a scrollable wheel helps a lot to quickly zoom in/out. Click and hold to pan the map left/right, up/down.
