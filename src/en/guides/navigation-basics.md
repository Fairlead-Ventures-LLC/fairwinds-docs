# Navigation Basics

<p class="lead">Two things to understand before anything else: the compass and the reckoning line.</p>

---

## The Compass

The compass controls your boat's heading. You have two ways to change course:

- Press the **← and →** arrow keys to nudge your heading left or right
- **Click and drag** the blue diamond on the compass rose

**Important:** your boat won't actually change course until you hit the **'Set' button**. This means you can freely experiment with a new heading and see where it takes you before committing.

## The Reckoning Line

The reckoning line is the projected path of your boat — where you will actually go based on your current heading and the wind.

A few things worth knowing early on:

- **Crash detection follows the reckoning line**, not your route line. If your reckoning line is clear, you are safe.
- The reckoning line and your route line are not always the same thing. A route line just draws a line between waypoints — the reckoning line shows the real path your boat will sail to get there (using great circle calculations).
- If you don't have a route active, the reckoning line shows where your current fixed heading takes you.

## Route Line vs Reckoning Line

This trips up a lot of new sailors. The short version:

- **Route line** — the line drawn between your waypoints. Visual only.
- **Reckoning line** — the actual projected path of your boat. This is what matters.

When a route is active, your reckoning line will follow it. But if your route line is set to 'rhumb' and the distances are long, the reckoning line may curve away from it. See [Rhumb vs Great Circle](/en/guides/rhumb-vs-great-circle/) for more on that.
